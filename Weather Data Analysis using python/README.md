# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing historical weather data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights using Python. It utilizes data science libraries to visualize, clean, and interpret weather conditions over time.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Load and preprocess weather data
- Analyze temperature, humidity, and rainfall trends
- Visualize seasonal and monthly variations
- Detect outliers or anomalies in the weather data
- Derive insights that could be useful for forecasting or decision-making

---

## 📁 Files

- `Weather Data Analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all analysis steps
- `weather_data.csv` (or similar) – the dataset used in the analysis (you may need to add this manually)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- `pandas` – for data loading and manipulation  
- `numpy` – for numerical computations  
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` – for data visualization  
- `datetime` – for handling time series  
- `scikit-learn` (optional) – for feature extraction or anomaly detection

---

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed

- **Missing Data Handling**: Checked for null values and handled them appropriately
- **Temperature Trends**: Analyzed average, min, and max temperatures across months and years
- **Rainfall Analysis**: Summarized total rainfall patterns and seasonal impact
- **Humidity Distribution**: Visualized and interpreted relative humidity levels
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified unusual spikes or drops in weather metrics
- **Time Series Visualization**: Plotted trends using line graphs, heatmaps, and boxplots

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations

- Monthly Average Temperature Line Chart  
- Rainfall by Season Bar Plot  
- Humidity Boxplots by Month  
- Heatmap of Daily Temperature Across the Year  

(You can generate these plots by running the notebook)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   
## 🔍Insights & Observations
-Temperature steadily increases from winter to summer, with peak heat in July.
-Rainfall is highest during monsoon months.
-Certain days show abnormal values—potential data errors or extreme weather events.
-Humidity tends to remain consistently high during specific months, influencing temperature comfort levels.

## 📌 Future Improvements
-Integrate weather forecasts for prediction
-Use machine learning models for temperature or rainfall prediction
-Add interactive dashboards with Plotly or Streamlit
